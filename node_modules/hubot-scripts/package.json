  "readme": "# hubot-scripts\n\nThese are a collection of community scripts for [hubot][hubot], a chat bot for\nyour company.\n\n\n## Discovering\n\nCheck out the [hubot-script-catalog][script-catalog] for a list and description\nof all the available scripts.\n\n## Installing\n\nOnce you have Hubot installed, you should already have `hubot-scripts`\ninstalled. Check `package.json` to be sure. If that is the case, you update\n`hubot-scripts.json` to list any scripts from this repository you want to load.\nThe default `hubot-scripts.json` looks like:\n\n    [\"redis-brain.coffee\", \"tweet.coffee\", \"shipit.coffee\"]\n    \nIf you update `hubot-scripts` in `package.json`, you will automatically get\nupdates to your scripts listed here.\n    \nAlternatively, you can copy files from this repository into your `scripts`\ndirectory. Note that you would not get updates from the `hubot-scripts`\nrepository unless you copy them yourself.\n\nAny third-party dependencies for scripts need the addition of your\n`package.json` otherwise a lot of errors will be thrown during the start up of\nyour hubot. You can find a list of dependencies for a script in the\ndocumentation header at the top of the script.\n\nRestart your robot, and you're good to go.\n\nAll the scripts in this repository are located in [`src/scripts`][src-scripts].\n\n## Writing\n\nWant to write your own Hubot script? The best way is to take a look at an\n[existing script][example-script] and see how things are set up. Hubot scripts\nare written in CoffeeScript, a higher-level implementation of JavaScript.\n\nAdditionally, it's extremely helpful to add [TomDoc][tomdoc] to the top of each\nfile. (Check out [an example][example-script-doc]). We'll pull out the commands\nfrom those lines and display them in the generic, robot-wide `hubot help`\ncommand.\n\nPlease note we're no longer including external dependencies in the\n`package.json`, so should you wish to include them please include the package\nname and required version in the TomDoc comments at the top of your script.\n\n## Documentation\n\nWe're now requiring all scripts in hubot-scripts to contain a documentation\nheader so people know every thing about the script.\n\n```coffeescript\n# Description\n#   <description of the scripts functionality>\n#\n# Dependencies:\n#   \"<module name>\": \"<module version>\"\n#\n# Configuration:\n#   LIST_OF_ENV_VARS_TO_SET\n#\n# Commands:\n#   hubot <trigger> - <what the respond trigger does>\n#   <trigger> - <what the hear trigger does>\n#\n# Notes:\n#   <optional notes required for the script>\n#\n# Author:\n#   <github username of the original script author>\n```\n\nIf you have nothing to fill in for a section you should include `None` in that\nsection. Empty sections which are optional should be left blank. A script will\nbe required to fill out the documentation before being merged into the\nrepository.\n\n[hubot]: https://github.com/github/hubot\n[script-catalog]: http://hubot-script-catalog.herokuapp.com\n[src-scripts]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/tree/master/src/scripts\n[tomdoc]: http://tomdoc.org\n[example-script]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/tweet.coffee \n[hubot-script-tests]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/test/tests.coffee\n[example-script-doc]: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/speak.coffee#L1-5\n",
